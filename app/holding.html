            <p><b>Friday:</b><br>
            For out of towners: Get yourself, your La Grange bags (link to packing list), and your bike to Katy Mills, Texas. There are three hotels just a mile or so from the start – The Katy Mills Springhill Suites, Courtyard, and Garden Inn. If you haven’t already booked a room, book quickly! These hotels will sell out.</p>

            <p>If you’re coming from Austin, we’ll be in touch about arranging a ride for you and your bike. If you’re from beyond Houston and Austin, welcome to the best MS ride there is! We’re here to support you – just let us know (contact form link)  if you have questions about getting to Katy Mills.</p>

            <p><b>Saturday:</b><br>
            For locals: Get to Brookshire Brothers by 5:30 to make sure you have time to load up your La Grange bag in the U-Haul and grab a snack from the Deloitte starting line team.</p>

            <p>For out of towners: The U-Haul will stop at each of the Katy Mills hotels at 5AM, so be sure to have yourself, your bike and your La Grange bag in the lobby by then. Once the luggage is clear, we’ll all meet up in the Springhill lobby and ride the mile to the starting line (with a quick stop at Starbucks on the way)</p>

            <p>nce the team is all together, we’ll pose for the group shot and then - as soon as it’s light - off we go!</p>

            <p>There are rest stops about every 12 miles on the ride, with lunch about 35 miles in. Most of the first day is flat, easy roads. About 85 miles after we start, we’ll arrive in La Grange. We’ll update this site with our tent location as soon as we get it confirmed - it’ll be easy to find in the fair grounds. Drop your bike off, come on inside, enjoy the food and drinks and kick back after a long haul on the bike. Your luggage will be waiting for you when you arrive.</p>

            <p><b>Sunday:</b><br>
            Early in the morning the lights will come back up, and it’s back in the saddle. Breakfast will be at the tent, and then we’ll load up our bags, throw them back in the U-Haul and head out to the La Grange start line for Day 2.</p>

            <p>Day 2 riding is a lot shorter - about 55 miles - but also hillier. The finish this year is at the Circuit of the Americas. There will be a Deloitte tent with fresh-grilled hot dogs, hamburgers and veggie options, beer and drinks, and a volunteer crew that will be very happy to see you. Just follow the signs across the finish line and head to our tent. Busses and bike transport will be heading back to Houston all day long. For Austin folks, parking for friends and family will be a piece of cake - just load up and go whenever you’re ready.</p>
