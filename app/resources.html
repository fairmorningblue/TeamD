            <h2>Team Deloitte Jersey — Required to Ride</h2>
            <p>Every rider on Team Deloitte wears a Deloitte jersey. We also have shorts, socks and warmers for those that want a totally coordinated kit. Ordering is easy - just order what you’d like from our <a href="https://team-deloitte.squarespace.com/" target="_blank">online store</a> - all items will be available for pickup at either the Houston or Austin offices, with direct delivery available to folks coming in from out of town.</p>

            <p>The minimum required to ride is one jersey, though many prefer to have two on hand so there’s a fresh jersey for day two without all that rinsing and hanging to dry. We’ll be sticking with the same jersey design this year, so if you already have a jersey, feel free to wear again this year.</p>

            <p>All kit items will be provided at cost – $60 for the jersey, $12 for arm warmers, $7 per pair for socks, and $80 for shorts. If you’ve been shopping for bike apparel, you know that these prices are a steal, especially since we’ll be getting top of the line Primal and Sock Guy items.</p>

            <p>Water bottles are on us this year! We’ll be providing two insulated CamelBack Team Deloitte water bottles to every rider.</p>

            <h2>Logistics</h2>
            <p>Our start point, as always, is the glamorous parking lot of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brookshire+Brothers/@29.7913838,-95.8133982,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xcedd78c15ead0b06!8m2!3d29.8002846!4d-95.8099221" target="_blank">Brookshire Brothers grocery store</a>. Houston locals, feel free to drive in and leave your car near the back of the parking lot for the ride. For out-of-towners this gets a little more complicated. Let’s break it down:</p>

            <p><b>Before ride weekend:</b><br>
            You need to raise at least $400 to ride the BP MS 150 - now that the MS Society has linked up to enable Facebook fundraisers, getting to $400 (and beyond) will go quicker than you think.</p>

            <p>Once you’ve raised the $400, you’re eligible for packet pick up - both the Austin and Houston teams will pick up everyone’s packet at once, so you’ll just need to get to the office after April 15 to pick yours up. Out of towners, just let us know where you’d like it shipped and we’ll get the packet to you. In your packets are numbers and instructions - one goes on your jersey, one on your helmet, one on your luggage, a couple go on your bike, and the wristband goes on your wrist.</p>

             <h2>Friday</h2>
              <p>For out of towners: Get yourself, your La Grange bags (link to packing list), and your bike to Katy Mills, Texas. There are three hotels just a mile or so from the start – The Katy Mills Springhill Suites, Courtyard, and Garden Inn. If you haven’t already booked a room, book quickly! These hotels will sell out.</p>

              <p>If you’re coming from Austin, we’ll be in touch about arranging a ride for you and your bike. If you’re from beyond Houston and Austin, welcome to the best MS ride there is! We’re here to support you – just let us know (contact form link)  if you have questions about getting to Katy Mills.</p>

            <div class="card">
              <h2>Saturday</h2>
              <p>For locals: Get to Brookshire Brothers by 5:30 to make sure you have time to load up your La Grange bag in the U-Haul and grab a snack from the Deloitte starting line team.</p>

              <p>For out of towners: The U-Haul will stop at each of the Katy Mills hotels at 5AM, so be sure to have yourself, your bike and your La Grange bag in the lobby by then. Once the luggage is clear, we’ll all meet up in the Springhill lobby and ride the mile to the starting line (with a quick stop at Starbucks on the way)</p>

              <p>Once the team is all together, we’ll pose for the group shot and then - as soon as it’s light - off we go!</p>

              <p>There are rest stops about every 12 miles on the ride, with lunch about 35 miles in. Most of the first day is flat, easy roads. About 85 miles after we start, we’ll arrive in La Grange. We’ll update this site with our tent location as soon as we get it confirmed - it’ll be easy to find in the fair grounds. Drop your bike off, come on inside, enjoy the food and drinks and kick back after a long haul on the bike. Your luggage will be waiting for you when you arrive.</p>
            </div><!--card-->

            <div class="card">
              <h2>Sunday</h2>
              <p>Early in the morning the lights will come back up, and it’s back in the saddle. Breakfast will be at the tent, and then we’ll load up our bags, throw them back in the U-Haul and head out to the La Grange start line for Day 2.</p>

              <p>Day 2 riding is a lot shorter - about 55 miles - but also hillier. The finish this year is at the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brookshire+Brothers/@29.7913838,-95.8133982,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xcedd78c15ead0b06!8m2!3d29.8002846!4d-95.8099221" target="_blank">Circuit of the Americas</a>. There will be a Deloitte tent with fresh-grilled hot dogs, hamburgers and veggie options, beer and drinks, and a volunteer crew that will be very happy to see you. Just follow the signs across the finish line and head to our tent. Busses and bike transport will be heading back to Houston all day long. For Austin folks, parking for friends and family will be a piece of cake - just load up and go whenever you’re ready.</p>

              <h2>Packing List</h2>
              <p>Packing for La Grange can be a bit intimidating first time through. You’ve got a max of two bags (including your cot). We’re here to make it easier.</p>

              <h3>You and your bike:</h3>

              <p><b>Bike: </b>
                Bike in good working order, numbers from your BP MS 150 packet applied. Saddle bag with a spare tube, tire levers, and a CO2 inflator kit. Nice to have: a rear light or reflector is a good safety measure. If you’re a non-Houstonian starting Day 1 from the Katy Mills hotels you’ll need a front and rear light since we’ll be heading off before dawn.</p>

                <p><b>You: </b>
                  Helmet, gloves, bike shorts, shoes, Team Deloitte jersey - extras like arm warmers or a bike jacket depending on the weather. Don’t forget sunglasses if you wear them, a little extra cash stashed in a jersey pocket for emergencies, and, if you like them, your favorite sport gels or jelly beans. It’s always fun to post to social media from the ride, so many people bring their phone along too.</p>

                  <p><b>In the La Grange bag:</b></p>

                  <ul>
                    <li><strong>Bike Kit for day 2</strong>
                    Shorts, Socks, Jersey (or rinse out Day one jersey), and any extra items you may need (arm warmers, knee warmers, etc.)</li>

                    <li><strong>Clothes for La Grange</strong>
                    Something to change into the afternoon of Day one. Don’t forget street shoes – walking around all afternoon in bike shoes can be a (literal) pain. Sunday morning can be chilly, even in late April, so consider a sweatshirt or light jacket. </li>

                    <li><strong>Electronics</strong>
                    Charger for your phone and bike computer if you need them. If you have a backup battery, this is a great time to pack it - outlets are pretty limited in the tent.</li>

                    <li><strong>Toiletries & Towel</strong>
                    Showers are provided at La Grange, but you’ll need to bring your own toiletries and towel. While there will be sunscreen nearly every single place you stop, it’s always a good idea to bring your own.</li>

                    <li><strong>Bedding</strong>
                    You’ll need to bring sleeping gear with you – a sleeping bag is the bare minimum, but we recommend you also consider something to sleep on – a cot is the most comfortable, but  a pad works too, especially if you’re a camping pro – and a pillow.</li>

                    <li><strong>Extras for the Ride</strong>
                    You never know what Day One will bring, so we recommend you pack an extra tube, CO2 cartridge, and energy bars or gels for on-the-bike snacking on Sunday.</li>
                  </ul>

              <h2>Buying a bike</h2>
              <p>Whether you’re considering your first bike or adding a bike to the stable, we are community with ideas to share.</p>
              <p>As a quick primer for first timers, we offer the following bits of collective wisdom:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>The BP MS 150 is easiest if you have a road bike, characterized by curved handlebars, multiple gears, and relatively narrow tires. These bikes are easier to ride for long distances since they offer lighter weight, a more efficient ride, and multiple hand positions.</li>
                  <li>Ride before you buy if possible. Find a good local bike shop and try out different bikes before you settle on the one you love. Bike store people LOVE to help, and love it when new people get engaged.</li>
                  <li>Use your fitness subsidy! Deloitte covers 50% of fitness purchases up to $500 per year, including a new bike, or new parts for your existing bike.</li>
                  <li>Don’t be afraid of entry-level bikes. Road bikes selling for less than $1,000 today are built to standards that were top of the line just a few years ago.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Still got questions? Let us know (link to contact form) and we’ll be happy to help!</p>
